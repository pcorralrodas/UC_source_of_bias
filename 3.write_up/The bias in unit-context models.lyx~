\begin_layout Abstract
This paper explores why small area poverty estimates from models at the
 household level, but that only use aggregate data as covariates, exhibit
 systematic bias.
 The analysis demonstrates that this bias stems from the models' inability
 to fully capture between-household variation in welfare, as they rely solely
 on covariates aggregated at geographic levels.
 Through model-based simulations, I show that the bias in these models is
 minimized when the empirical variability of simulated welfare based on
 the model is closest to the true empirical variance of welfare at the area
 level.
 The finding also has implications for bias in unit-level models.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys aimed at gauging a population's living standards often
 lack representativeness beyond broad regions or specific population demographic
s.
 Additionally, there is a risk that many pertinent locations or groups may
 be omitted from these surveys.
 However, detailed information on poverty is crucial for effectively targeting
 resources to alleviate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The demand for disaggregated statistics has increased the reliance on indirect
 techniques that integrate supplementary data from censuses, registries,
 or larger-scale surveys.
 These methods are used to produce sufficiently precise statistics for granular
 populations.
 Small area estimation encompasses a broad range of statistical techniques
 designed to enhance the precision of estimates when household surveys lack
 the sample size required for the desired level of accuracy.
 Among these techniques, model-based approaches stand out by leveraging
 the concept of "borrowing strength" from larger datasets or auxiliary informati
on.
 These methods use models that establish relationships across areas (e.g.,
 regression techniques), enabling the creation of indirect estimators (

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most model-based techniques fall into two main categories: unit-level models
 and area-level models.
 Unit-level models are generally applied when data on individual units (e.g.,
 households) are available, while area-level models are used when only aggregate
 data for specific geographic areas (e.g., area means) are accessible, as
 described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fay1979estimates"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In poverty estimation, unit-level models predict the welfare distribution
 first and then apply a threshold to determine the proportion of people
 below that threshold.
 In contrast, area-level models directly estimate the poverty rate for an
 area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unit-level models face limitations when survey and census data are from
 different years â€” a common issue in developing countries where censuses
 and surveys are conducted infrequently.
 Area-level models, however, provide a feasible alternative.
 These models rely on linear functional forms and perform estimation and
 prediction using only aggregate data for geographic entities of interest
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "fay1979estimates"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "torabi2014small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another approach, unit-context models, employs an estimation stage where
 household-level measures are modeled as a linear function of area-level
 characteristics (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "nguyen2012method,lange2018small,masaki2020small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Unit-context, like unit-level models predict the welfare distribution first
 and then apply a threshold to determine the proportion of people below
 that threshold, but do so only using area-level characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although alluring, unit-context models, have been discouraged due to the
 method resulting in biased estimates.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor

\end_inset

 (2022) show that the method is unable to fully replicate the welfare distributi
on which results in biased estimates.
 For a practical example of the resulting bias, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In that work the authors present the aggregated estimates at the geographic
 level of representativeness and it is evident that across many areas the
 differences to direct estimates are considerable (see Figures 7 to 9).
 Moreover, it can be seen that the majority of the estimates fall above
 the 45 degree line, suggesting an upward bias in the estimates.
 Using real world data, where samples are taken following methods implemented
 in developing countries, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "corral2023poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 present evidence on how unit-context models produce biased estimates of
 poverty and that the noise and bias of unit-context models is considerably
 larger than that produced by area-level models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key question is what is the source of the bias in unit-context models.
 In this note, the simulations implemented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "corral2022guidelines"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (2022) are used to study the source of the method's bias.
 The bias studied here, goes beyond the potential bias of the method noted
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "rodas2021pull"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (2021) which was related to a sampling issue.
 Instead, the bias noted in this paper, is related to the transformation
 bias noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wurz2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These authors attempt to address the same issue as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 of not having auxiliary microdata and relying on aggregate population-level
 auxiliary information.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wurz2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note that relying on aggregate level data to model household-level welfare
 leads to first-order bias from back-transformation and second-order bias
 from using aggregate data.
 They note that using aggregate means as covariates instead of individual
 values introduces additional bias due to the convexity of the back-transformati
on function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bias studied here is related to the poor model explanatory power of
 unit-context models and is related to the bias noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wurz2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Because unit-context methods model transformed household-level welfare
 as a linear function of area-level covariates only, these are unable to
 adequately account for between household variations in welfare.
 The simulations undertaken here show that areas where the variance of predicted
 welfare is aligned to the area's true variance of welfare are those that
 exhibit the lowest bias across the entire welfare distribution.
 This illustrates that under unit-level and unit-context models bias at
 the area level is a function of the dependent variable's mean and the empirical
 variance of the linear fit.
 The dependent variable benefits from the use of EB methods but the empirical
 variance is fully dependent on the auxiliary data at hand and how aligned
 it is to the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The note proceeds to present the assumed model for unit-level small area
 estimation and provides a discussion on why not accounting for variance
 leads to biased estimates of poverty.
 The method for creating simulated data is illustrated, followed by the
 results.
 Finally, conclusions are presented.

One of the main assumptions is that errors are normally distributed.
 The assumption implies that, conditional on the observed characteristics,
 the model's errors are normally distributed.
 To obtain estimates, the first step is to fit the model from Eq.

 to the observed sample data via any method providing consistent estimators.
 Usual fitting methods under this approach are maximum likelihood (ML) or
 restricted maximum likelihood (REML), both based on the normal likelihood,
 and H3 method, which does not specify a distribution.
 This yields the vector of parameter estimates:

 This Monte Carlo procedure is often repeated 100 times in ordet to derive
 indicators under each simulated population and then average across to derive
 the final EB estimate.
 Notice how in the simulated vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{ah}\hat{\beta}+\hat{\gamma}_{a}\left(\bar{y}_{a}-\bar{x}_{a}\hat{\beta}\right)$

Alternatively, because we assume normally distributed errors, the probability
 of being poor for any household 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a$

 is entirely dependent on its expected welfare, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{h}\hat{Î²},$
\end_inset

 its idiosyncratic error, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{e}_{h}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}_{a}\left(\bar{y}_{a}-\bar{x}_{a}\hat{\beta}\right)$
\end_inset

 which are assumed to follow 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{h}\sim N(0,Ïƒ_{e}^{2})$

\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{a}\sim N\left(\gamma_{a}\left(\bar{y}_{a}-\bar{x}_{a}\beta\right),\sigma_{\eta}^{2}(1-\gamma_{a})\right)$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The empirical best estimated probability of a household being poor is given
 by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

Under the assumed model, variation in simulated welfare across the population
 (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y_{a}}^{2*}$

\begin_inset Formula $S_{\hat{y}_{a}}^{2*}=\frac{1}{N_{a}}\sum_{h}\left(\hat{y}_{ah}-\bar{y}_{a}^{*}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N_{a}}\sum_{h}\left(\varepsilon_{ah}^{*2}\right)$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
The bias of poverty estimates at the area level will be determined by difference

 This is simplified if we assume that the dependent variable for a given
 area follows a log-normal distribution.
 Then the simulated poverty rate for a given area under a given threshold
 (

 under the assumption is:
\end_layout

When simulating vectors of the dependent variable at the national level,
 the empirical standard deviation of the dependent variable is approximated
 under unit-level and unit-context models.
 However, under unit-context models the empirical standard deviation at
 the area level is not properly approximated due to the model misspecification.
 Consequently, when creating simulated vectors of welfare under unit context
 models the variation in simulated welfare across the population in an area
 (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y_{a}}^{2*}$
\end_inset

) will not match that of the true population.
 From Eq.

 Nevertheless, this seems to only hold true when estimating the mean of
 the dependent variable of the model is the goal.
 It does not hold true when the goal is estimating the original untransformed

 Under unit-context models, bias is introduced when the goal is a measure

Assuming log linearity, the simulated nested error model (

 Since

Because poverty is predicted across the 99 thresholds noted in the previous
 section, it is possible to plot how bias across all lines and areas is
 present.
 The 99 percentiles are considered since the goal of unit-level small area
 estimation of poverty is to replicate the full welfare distribution and
 from it, estimate poverty.
 The simulations presented here, train the model and predict using the same
 data, thus sampling does not play a role.
 This is done in order to remove other potential sources of bias from unit-conte

\begin_inset Formula $S_{\hat{y}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 across areas.
 The true empirical variation of the explained portion, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\hat{y}}^{2}$
\end_inset

,ranges from 0.37 for the area with the lowest empirical variation to 0.86
 to the area with the largest, a similar range to the EB model.
 However, the range for the unit-context model is much smaller, from 0.07
 to 0.1.
 Nevertheless, on average, the total empirical variation of the dependent
 variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}^{2}$
\end_inset

, is matched by unit-context models (Table

; mean).
 This is because the model is fit at the national level and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are estimated to be much larger since the covariates capture so little
 of the total empirical variance of the dependent variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, the range for the total empirical variance of the areas is
 minimal, from 0.813 to 0.844, compared to the truth of 0.632 to 1.119.
 Thus, in the unit-context models the larger estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 only works at the national level, across areas this leads to some areas

Unit-context models are biased because these deviate from the truth by assuming
 welfare is not dependent on unit level characteristics, which leads to
 poor fitting models.

 illustrates how this is manifested across select poverty lines.
 The absolute bias for a given area decrease as the ratio of model explained
 variance to true variance for a given area gets close to 1.
 Therefore, even if the use of empirical best methods guarantees that the
 mean of the dependent variable of the model at the area level is unbiased,
 because poverty is distribution dependent, the inability of unit-context
 models to approximate the full distribution at the area level leads to
 biased poverty estimates.

A similar issue is observed for welfare (

 The absolute bias decreases as

 Considering that the true area values of untransformed welfare range from
 roughly 18 to 110, the bias for some areas is quite considerable.
 In accordance to what was noted in section

 Nevertheless,

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper provides evidence that the bias in unit-context models for small
 area poverty estimation stems primarily from their inability to adequately
 capture the full variance of welfare at the area level.
 While these models may achieve unbiased estimates of mean transformed welfare
 (i.e.
 the model's dependent variable) through empirical best prediction methods,
 they systematically fail to replicate the true welfare distribution within
 areas, leading to biased poverty estimates and welfare estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulation results reveal several key insights:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, unit-context models typically explain only a small portion of the
 total variance in welfare (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 ranging from 0.13 to 0.25) compared to traditional unit-level models (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 around 0.50).
 This limited explanatory power arises because unit-context models rely
 solely on area-level covariates, omitting household-level variation.
 Adding more covariates to the unit-context model risks overfitting and
 could lead to further bias, thus the solution is not aligned to adding
 more data.
 An approach similar to the one presented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wurz2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 could work, but may require having access to unit-level data and thus is
 not feasible when using satellite derived data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, while unit-context models may be able to match at the national level
 the total empirical variation of welfare through the estimation of area
 and household error components (
\begin_inset Formula $Ïƒ_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

), this compensation mechanism breaks down at the area level.
 Some areas end up with significantly over- or under-estimated variation
 of welfare, leading to systematic bias in poverty estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, our analysis reveals that the magnitude of bias in poverty estimates
 is directly related to how well the model simulated total empirical variation
 of welfare matches the true welfare's variability in each area.
 Areas where this ratio approaches 1 show minimal bias, while areas with
 substantial mismatches exhibit larger biases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings have important implications for practitioners.
 While unit-context models offer practical advantages in situations where
 household-level census data is unavailable or outdated, their inherent
 limitations in capturing welfare distributions should be carefully considered.
 Users should be particularly cautious when interpreting poverty estimates
 for areas where the model's simulated variability of welfare differs substantia
lly from the observed welfare's empirical variance in survey data.
 As noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "corral2023poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "corral2022guidelines"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, using simulated and real world data, area-level models such as the well
 known Fay Herriot model will outperform unit-context models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future research might explore methods to improve the empirical variance
 approximation in unit-context models or develop diagnostic tools to identify
 areas where these models are most likely to produce reliable estimates.
 Additionally, investigating alternative approaches that better capture
 within-area welfare distributions while maintaining the practical advantages
 of unit-context models could prove valuable.
