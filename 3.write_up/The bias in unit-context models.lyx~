\begin_layout Abstract
This paper explores why poverty estimates from unit-context models exhibit
 systematic bias.
 The analysis demonstrates that this bias stems from these models' inability
 to fully capture between-household variation in welfare, as they rely solely
 on covariates aggregated at geographic levels.
 Through model-based simulations, we show that the bias in unit-context
 models is minimized when the share of total variance explained by the model
 matches the true variance of welfare at the area level.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Household surveys aimed at gauging a population's living standards often
 lack representativeness beyond broad regions or specific population demographic
s.
 Additionally, there is a risk that many pertinent locations or groups may
 be omitted from these surveys.
 However, detailed information on poverty is crucial for effectively targeting
 resources to alleviate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The demand for disaggregated statistics necessitates the use of indirect
 techniques, which integrate supplementary data from censuses, registries,
 or larger-scale surveys to generate sufficiently precise statistics for
 granular populations.
 Small area estimation encompasses a wide spectrum of statistical methods
 aimed at enhancing the precision of estimates in cases where household
 surveys lack sufficient sample size to achieve the desired level of accuracy.
 Among these methods, model-based approaches leverage the concept of "borrowing
 strength" from larger datasets or auxiliary information across different
 areas through models that establish connections between them (such as regressio
n-type techniques), resulting in indirect estimators (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "molina2010small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Most model-based techniques can be classified into two main groups: those
 based on unit-level models and those based on area-level models.
 The former are typically employed when data on individual units (e.g., households
) are accessible, while the latter are utilized in situations where only
 aggregate data at the area level (e.g., area means) are available, as outlined
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fay1979estimates"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unit-level models are generally unsuitable when survey and census data correspon
d to different years — an issue common in developing countries where censuses
 and surveys are conducted infrequently.
 In contrast, area-level models offer a viable alternative.
 These models rely on linear functional forms but perform estimation and
 prediction using only aggregate data for the geographic entities of interest
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fay1979estimates"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "torabi2014small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another approach, unit-context models, features an estimation stage where
 household-level measures are modeled solely as a linear function of area-level
 characteristics (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "nguyen2012method,lange2018small,masaki2020small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unit-context models, however, have been discouraged due to the method resulting
 in biased estimates.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "corral2022guidelines"

\end_inset

 (2022) show that the method is unable to fully replicate the welfare distributi
on which results in biased estimates.
 For a practical example of the resulting bias, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "edochie2024small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In that work the authors present the aggregated estimates at the geographic
 level of representativeness and it is evident that across many areas the
 differences to direct estimates are considerable (see Figures 7 to 9).
 Moreover, it can be seen that the majority of the estimates fall above
 the 45 degree line, suggesting an upward bias in the estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key question is what is the source of the bias in unit-context models.
 In this note, the simulations implemented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "corral2022guidelines"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (2022) are used to study the source of the method's bias.
 The bias studied here, goes beyond the potential bias of the method noted
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "rodas2021pull"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (2021) which was related to a sampling issue.
 It is related to the transformation bias noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wurz2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These authors attempt to address the same issue as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "nguyen2012method"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 of not having auxiliary microdata and relying on aggregate population-level
 auxiliary information.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wurz2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note that relying on aggregate level data to model household-level welfare
 leads to first-order bias from back-transformation and second-order bias
 from using aggregate data.
 They note that using aggregate means instead of individual values introduces
 additional bias due to the convexity of the back-transformation function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bias studied here is related to the poor model explanatory power of
 unit-context models.
 Because unit-context methods model transformed household-level welfare
 as a linear function of area-level covariates these are unable to adequately
 account for between household variations in welfare.
 The simulations undertaken here show, that across the welfare distribution,
 areas where bias is lowest for these models are those where the ratio of
 total variance explained by the predicted welfare is closest to 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The note proceeds to present the assumed model for unit-level small area
 estimation and provides a discussion on why not accounting for variance
 leads to biased estimates of poverty.
 The method for creating simulated data is illustrated, followed by the
 results.
 Finally, conclusions are presented.

The model based small area estimation methods described in this chapter,
 are dependent on an assumed model.
 The nested error model used for small area was originally proposed by Battese,

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 assume that the transformed welfare 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ah}$
\end_inset

 for each household 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 within each location 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the population is linearly related to a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times K$
\end_inset

 vector of characteristics (or correlates) 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{ah}$
\end_inset

 for that household, according to the nested error model: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{ah}=x_{ah}\beta+\eta_{a}+e_{ah},\:h=1,\ldots,N_{c},\,a=1,\ldots,A,\label{eq:1-1-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{ah}$
\end_inset

 are respectively location and household-specific idiosyncratic errors,
 assumed to be independent from each other, following: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{a}\stackrel{iid}{\sim}N\left(0,\sigma_{\eta}^{2}\right),\:e_{ah}\stackrel{iid}{\sim}N\left(0,\sigma_{e}^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the variances 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are unknown.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the number of locations in which the population is divided and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the number of households in location 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1,\ldots,A$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the sample size from area 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $K\times1$
\end_inset

 vector of regression coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main assumptions is that errors are normally distributed.
 The assumption does not necessarily imply that welfare (the dependent variable)
 is normally distributed, but instead implies that, conditional on the observed
 characteristics, the residuals are normally distributed.
 Under the assumed model, variation in welfare across the population is
 determined by three components: the variation in household characteristics,
 the variation in household specific unobservables, and the variation in
 location specific effects.
 Within any given area, the welfare distribution is determined by the variation
 in household specific characteristics and household specific errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain estimates, the first step is to fit the model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 via any method providing consistent estimators.
 This yields the vector of parameter estimates: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\theta}_{0}=\left(\hat{\beta}_{0},\hat{\sigma}_{\eta0}^{2},\hat{\sigma}_{e0}^{2}\right).
\]

\end_inset

Usual fitting methods under this approach are maximum likelihood (ML) or
 restricted maximum likelihood (REML), both based on the normal likelihood,
 and H3 method, which does not require to specify a distribution.
 The empirical best (EB) area effects for the model are estimated from:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\eta}_{a0}=\hat{\gamma}_{a}\left(\bar{y}_{a}-\bar{x}_{a}\hat{\beta}_{0}\right),\quad\hat{\gamma}_{a}=\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{\eta0}^{2}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\eta0}^{2}+\hat{\sigma}_{e0}^{2}/n_{a}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance for the area effects are given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\sigma}_{\eta_{a}}=\sigma_{\eta0}^{2}(1-\hat{\gamma}_{a})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we assume normally distributed errors, the probability of being
 poor for any household 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 in area 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is entirely dependent on its expected welfare, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{h}\hat{β},$
\end_inset

 and its error, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{e}_{h}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\eta}_{a}$
\end_inset

 which are assumed to follow 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{h}\sim N(0,σ_{e}^{2})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{a}\sim N\left(\hat{\eta}_{a0},\hat{\sigma}_{\eta0}^{2}(1-\hat{\gamma}_{a})\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Prob\:poor_{ha}=Φ\,\left(\frac{z-x_{ha}\hat{β}-\hat{\eta}_{a0}}{\sqrt{\left(\hat{\sigma}_{\eta_{a}}^{2}+\hat{σ}{}_{e}^{2}\right)}}\right)\label{eq:cum prob}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is the transformed poverty threshold.
 The poverty rate for the area is given by the average probability of being
 poor across households.
 Within a given area, the only thing that varies across households are the
 covariates.

Unit-context models are an approximation to the assumed underlying data

 Unit-context versions (i.e.
 those with aggregated covariates only) are defined as models where household-le
vel welfare is modeled using only area and sub-area level characteristics.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "masaki2020small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that the model should include characteristics that explain variability
 at a geographic level below the one for which we aim to estimate poverty.
 A possible unit-context model follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{sach}=z_{sac}\alpha+t_{sc}\omega+g_{s}\lambda+\eta_{sc}+\varepsilon_{sach}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is used for an aggregation level that is over the target areas (a super-area)
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is used for subareas, e.g., clusters.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{sac}$
\end_inset

 contains subarea-level characteristics, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{sa}$
\end_inset

 includes area-level characteristics and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{s}$
\end_inset

 is composed of super-area-level characteristics (which may include super-area
 fixed effects).
 The regression coefficients across these levels are respectively denoted
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 The random effects, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{sa}$
\end_inset

, are specified in this model at the area level, same as in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:1-1-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Note that, among the set of covariates in this model, none is at the unit-level
; covariates only vary at the subarea-level and above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key feature of unit-context models is that the linear fit only explains
 a relatively small amount of the total variance of the dependent variable,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 that range between 0.15 to 0.25 in most instances.
 The variance explained is, understandably, less that the household-level
 model.
 The variance that is not explained due to the exclusion of household-level
 covariates is captured in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 At the national level this leads to the variance of the linear fit, plus
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 will be approximately equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var\mathit{\left[y\right]}.}$
\end_inset

This is true for unit-context and unit-level models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the area level, however, there will be differences and these will lead
 to bias.
 To see this, assume welfare for a given area follows a log-normal distribution.
 Also assume that the linear fit of Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:1-1-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is normally distributed.
 Then the poverty rate for a given area under these assumptions is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
FGT_{0a}=Φ\,\left(\frac{\ln z-\bar{x}\hat{\beta}-\hat{\eta}_{a}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{var}\mathit{\left[x_{h}\hat{\beta}\right]}+\hat{\sigma}_{\eta a}^{2}+\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the use of EB ensures that for every sampled area 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left[x\hat{\beta}+\hat{\eta}_{a}\right]=E\left[y_{a}\right]$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{hc}$
\end_inset

 is the transformed welfare.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 then at the area level bias in poverty arises because:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}\mathit{\left[x_{h}\hat{\beta}\right]}+\hat{\sigma}_{\eta a}^{2}+\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}\neq\mathrm{var\left[\mathit{y_{a}}\right]}.\label{eq:variance}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And because the variance of the linear fit of unit-context models is smaller,
 unit-context models are more likely to yield biased estimates of poverty.

The average difference between the true poverty indicator and the estimate
 across the 1,000 simulations represent the empirical bias for each area.
 The Stata script to replicate these simulations can be found in the appendix.

\begin_layout Standard
Because poverty is predicted across the 99 thresholds noted in the previous
 section, it is possible to plot how bias across all lines and areas is
 present.
 The simulations presented here, train the model and predict using the same
 data.
 This is done in order to remove other potential sources of bias from unit-conte
xt models, such as the potential omitted variable bias noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rodas2021pull"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As can be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bias"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the bias of unit-context models is present across all lines, but as noted
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "corral2022guidelines"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 the bias is lower for some areas and for some percentiles.

As argued in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the bias arises because at the area level, the unit-context model does
 a poor job at capturing the entire distribution's variance.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:var"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 presents the variance of the linear fit across areas.
 The true variance ranges from 0.37 to 0.86, a similar range to the CensusEB
 model.
 However, the range for the unit-context model is much smaller, from 0.07
 to 0.1.
 Nevertheless, on average the total variance of the unit-context model matches
 that of the true welfare and that of the CensusEB estimates (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:var2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This is because the model is fit at the national level and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are estimated to be much larger since the covariates capture so little
 of the total variance.
 Consequently, the range for the total variance of the areas is minimal.
 Thus, in the unit-context models the larger estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 only works at the national level, across areas this leads to some areas
 where the total variance considerably larger than the true variance and
 some where the variance is considerably smaller than the real variance.

 illustrates how this is manifested across select poverty lines.
 The absolute bias for a given area decrease as the ratio of model explained
 variance to true variance for a given area gets close to 1.
 Therefore, even if the use of empirical best methods guarantees that the
 mean of the dependent variable of the model at the area level is unbiased,
 because poverty is distribution dependent the inability of unit-context
 models to approximate the full distribution at the area level leads to
 biased poverty estimates.

 averages across all 99 poverty lines the bias from the model for each area.
 This figure makes it more salient how bias is at its minimal point around
 the point where the unit-context model's total variance is equal to the
 true dependent variable's variance in that area.
 Hence, estimates are biased for some areas more than for others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper demonstrates that the bias in unit-context models for small area
 poverty estimation stems primarily from their inability to adequately capture
 the full variance of welfare at the area level.
 While these models may achieve unbiased estimates of mean transformed welfare
 through empirical best prediction methods, they systematically fail to
 replicate the true welfare distribution within areas, leading to biased
 poverty estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulation results reveal several key insights:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, unit-context models typically explain only a small portion of the
 total variance in welfare (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 ranging from 0.13 to 0.25) compared to traditional unit-level models (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 around 0.50).
 This limited explanatory power arises because unit-context models rely
 solely on area-level covariates, omitting household-level variation.
 Adding more covariates to the unit-context model risks overfitting and
 could lead to further bias, thus the solution is not aligned to adding
 more data.
 An approach similar to the one presented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wurz2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 could work, but not when using satellite derived data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, while the total variance at the national level matches the true
 welfare variance through the estimation of area and household error components
 (
\begin_inset Formula $σ_{\eta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

), this compensation mechanism breaks down at the area level.
 Some areas end up with significantly over- or under-estimated total variance,
 leading to systematic bias in poverty estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, our analysis reveals that the magnitude of bias in poverty estimates
 is directly related to how well the model's total variance matches the
 true welfare variance in each area.
 Areas where this ratio approaches 1 show minimal bias, while areas with
 substantial variance mismatches exhibit larger biases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings have important implications for practitioners.
 While unit-context models offer practical advantages in situations where
 household-level census data is unavailable or outdated, their inherent
 limitations in capturing welfare distributions should be carefully considered.
 Users should be particularly cautious when interpreting poverty estimates
 for areas where the model's variance differs substantially from the observed
 welfare variance in survey data.
 As noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "corral2023poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, area-level models such as the well known Fay Herriot model will outperform
 unit-context models, when both use the same data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future research might explore methods to improve the variance approximation
 in unit-context models or develop diagnostic tools to identify areas where
 these models are most likely to produce reliable estimates.
 Additionally, investigating alternative approaches that better capture
 within-area welfare distributions while maintaining the practical advantages
 of unit-context models could prove valuable.
